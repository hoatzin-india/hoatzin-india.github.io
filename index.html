					<p>Hoatzin is a tropical bird found in the Amazon region of South America.
It is also infamously known as the stinkbird thanks to a foul odoured,
enlarged crop that it uses for fermentation of vegetable matter. This
rather colourful bird is hence quite disagreeable with the added fact
that human beings consider its meat also to be in bad taste. But enough
now about the creature that inspired our name and logo. Lets talk about us!</p>
<p>We at hoatzin conceptualize and design a wide array of material which at
this point include posters, brochures, booklets, t-shirts, caps, mousepads - do you still use them? - and of course the ubiquitous coffee cups. Hoatzin
was born (not the bird) out of sheer necessity when we just could not
agree with the aesthics that were available for the content that we
were generating. And just like our mascot we are perhaps disagreeable and
polarizing to some, but we promise to be original.</p>
<p>Not all of our work can be presented here. If we had to sound all pro
and high-end we could say something like &ldquo;for legal and copyright reasons&rdquo;
but then we would be lying. We don&rsquo;t do it because some
of it is so bad that it needs to ferment in a hoatzin&rsquo;s gut for eternity.
The rest half-decent ones we are presenting on this website.</p>
<p>Note that we don&rsquo;t have any sales yet, nor do we provide any services.
But if you like anything here and feel like saying &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;, do write to us
at the email id you will find somewhere on this website. If someday we
start selling stuff, you will be the first one that we inform. Do visit
again, we might some day have good stuff to sell. We need your money so
that we can send it to poor and dying hoatzins in the Amazon basin. Okay
we are kidding!</p>
